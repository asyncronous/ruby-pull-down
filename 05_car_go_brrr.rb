# PART 1
# Create a class called MyCar. 

# When you initialize a new instance or object of the class, 
# allow the user to input some instance variables that tell us the year, color, and model of the car. 

# Create an instance variable called speed that starts at 0 during instantiation of the object to track the current speed of the car.

# PART 2
# Create instance methods that allow the car to start the car, speed up, brake, and shut the car off.

# Make a change to your method to your MyCar class to allow you to update and view the color of your car. 

# Then make a change to your  method that allows you to view, but not modify, the year of your car.

# Create a method called spray_paint that can be called and given an instance of MyCar that will modify the color of the car.

# PART 3
# Now you have all the methods you need to drive your car,
# Create a program loop that will ask you, the user, what you want to do while driving (speed up, brake, turn on the car etc)

# It doesn't make sense to be able to speed up your car when its not turned on, or braking reduces your speed below 0.
# Write logic that will prevent these things and any other edge cases.
